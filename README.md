# CRUD-with-MySQL
This project is a user management application built with Express.js and MySQL for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It allows for the management of users in a database, including adding new users, displaying a list of users, updating user details, and deleting users.

# Key features:

- User creation: New users can be added to the database with a random username, email, and password using Faker.js for generating dummy data.
- View users: A simple interface to display a list of all users stored in the MySQL database.
- Edit user: Modify the username of an existing user by verifying their password.
- Delete user: Remove a user from the database after verifying the password.
- UUID for unique user identification: Each user is assigned a unique ID generated by UUIDv4.

# Technologies used:

- Node.js and Express for building the server and handling routing.
- MySQL for database management.
- Faker.js for generating random data for users.
- UUID for unique identification of users.
